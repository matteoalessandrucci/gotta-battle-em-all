# Gotta-battle-em-all

This project contains a simulation environment for Pok√©mon battles, designed to test various strategies and agents. Below is an overview of the folder structure and instructions on how to run tests using the provided Makefile.

## Folder Structure

- **src/**: Contains four files:
  - `main.py`: The main simulation script that initializes and runs the battles.
  - `MCTS.py`: Contains the implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) agent.
  - `MCTSxMinimax.py`: Implements the MCTSxMinimax agent, combining MCTS and Minimax strategies.
  - `Minimax.py`: Contains the Minimax agent implementation.
- **logs/**: Stores log files generated during simulations and batch tests. During each test, a dedicated subfolder is created that contains logs for individual battles, as well as an additional file summarizing final statistics.
- **Makefile**: Provides commands to run simulations and tests, and to clean up logs.
- **ux/**: (Optional) Includes UX components for visualizing battles.

## Running Tests

To perform different actions, you can use the Makefile by executing `make <target>` in the root directory. Available targets include:

- **`run-minimax`**: Runs the simulation script using Minimax without the UX.
  ```
  make run-minimax
  ```

- **`run-ux-minimax`**: Launches both the UX (in the background) and the simulation script using Minimax.
  ```
  make run-ux-minimax
  ```

- **`run-tests-minimax`**: Performs a batch test using Minimax, running the simulation multiple times and generating aggregated statistics.
  ```
  make run-tests-minimax
  ```

- **`run-mcts`**: Runs the simulation script using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) without the UX.
  ```
  make run-mcts
  ```

- **`run-tests-mcts`**: Performs a batch test using MCTS.
  ```
  make run-tests-mcts
  ```

- **`run-ux-mcts`**: Launches both the UX (in the background) and the simulation script using MCTS.
  ```
  make run-ux-mcts
  ```

- **`run-mctsxminimax`**: Runs the simulation script using MCTSxMinimax without the UX.
  ```
  make run-mctsxminimax
  ```

- **`run-tests-mctsxminimax`**: Performs a batch test using MCTSxMinimax.
  ```
  make run-tests-mctsxminimax
  ```

- **`run-ux-mctsxminimax`**: Launches both the UX (in the background) and the simulation script using MCTSxMinimax.
  ```
  make run-ux-mctsxminimax
  ```

- **`clean`**: Removes all logs.
  ```
  make clean
  ```
