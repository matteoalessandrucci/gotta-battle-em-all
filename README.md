# Gotta-battle-em-all

This project contains a simulation environment for Pok√©mon battles, designed to test various strategies and agents. Below is an overview of the folder structure and instructions on how to run tests using the provided Makefile.

## Folder Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main simulation script and related classes.
- **logs/**: Stores log files generated during simulations and batch tests.
- **Makefile**: Provides commands to run simulations and tests, and to clean up logs.
- **ux/**: (Optional) Includes UX components for visualizing battles.

## Running Tests

To perform different actions, you can use the Makefile by executing `make <target>` in the root directory. Available targets include:

- **`run-prova`**: Runs the simulation script without the UX.
  ```
  make run-prova
  ```

- **`run-all`**: Launches both the UX (in the background) and the simulation script.
  ```
  make run-all
  ```

- **`run-tests`**: Performs a batch test, running the simulation multiple times and generating aggregated statistics.
  ```
  make run-tests
  ```

- **`clean`**: Removes all logs.
  ```
  make clean
  ```
